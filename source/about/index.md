[Daniel Childs](mailto:daniel@webbiscuit.co.uk) works for a software consultancy in Nottingham, and this is his personal website. 
It is a hideously over-engineered static site, with content written in [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) and built using [Hexo](https://hexo.io/).

This website is open source, because I know you all want to reproduce it: [https://github.com/webbiscuit/webbiscuit-website](https://github.com/webbiscuit/webbiscuit-website).

Here is some software that I write and sell: [https://www.crumblyheadgames.co.uk](https://www.crumblyheadgames.co.uk). It helps you write ~~choose your own adventure books~~ gamebooks! There will be a web version one day, and I should write more about it.
