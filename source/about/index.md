[Daniel Childs](mailto:daniel@webbiscuit.co.uk) works for a software consultancy in Nottingham, and this is his personal website. 
It is a hideously over-engineered static site, with content written in [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) and built using [Hexo](https://hexo.io/).

It is open source: [https://github.com/webbiscuit/webbiscuit-website](https://github.com/webbiscuit/webbiscuit-website).
