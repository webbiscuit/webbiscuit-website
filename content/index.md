# Web Biscuit

Hi! Welcome to the Web Biscuit website. My name is [Daniel Childs](mailto:daniel@webbiscuit.co.uk), a professional software developer based in Nottingham, and this is my personal webpage. It is an entirely static site 
written in [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), built using [Metalsmith](http://www.metalsmith.io/), scripted by gulp and optimised by webpack. It uses node and npm as
the build environment.

It is also open source! [https://github.com/webbiscuit/webbiscuit-website](https://github.com/webbiscuit/webbiscuit-website).


## Articles

Here are some of the articles I wrote for Code Project a while ago.

I should revise these at some point, but they are here in their original form for now.

### Design Patterns

- [Strategy Pattern](./strategy-pattern/)
- [Factory Pattern](./factory-pattern/)

### C++

- [Debugging Memory Leaks in VC++](./cpp-memory-leaks/)
