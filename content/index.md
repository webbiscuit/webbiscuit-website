# Web Biscuit

[Daniel Childs](mailto:daniel@webbiscuit.co.uk) works for a software consultancy in Nottingham, and this is his personal website. 
It is a hideously over-engineered static site, with content
written in [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), built using [Metalsmith](http://www.metalsmith.io/), and bundled with [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/). 

It is also open source: [https://github.com/webbiscuit/webbiscuit-website](https://github.com/webbiscuit/webbiscuit-website).
