# Articles

Here are some of the articles I wrote for Code Project a while ago.

They are old, and I should revise these at some point.

## Design Patterns

- [Strategy Pattern](./strategy-pattern/)
- [Factory Pattern](./factory-pattern/)

## C++

- [Debugging Memory Leaks in VC++](./cpp-memory-leaks/)
