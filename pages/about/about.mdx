# WOOT

Hey! I'm Daniel Childs. I'm a software consulant working in Nottingham, UK.

This is my hideously over-engineered static site, with content written in [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) and built using [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/).

This website is open source, because I know you all want to reproduce it: [https://github.com/webbiscuit/webbiscuit-website](https://github.com/webbiscuit/webbiscuit-website).

I also wrote some software that helps you write ~~choose your own adventure books~~ gamebooks: [https://www.crumblyheadgames.co.uk](https://www.crumblyheadgames.co.uk). There will be a web version one day.
