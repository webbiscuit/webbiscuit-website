An interesting post about how it's going to be different this time around. I'm going to write a lot more nowadays and use this blog to improve my writing.

Here is code:


```csharp
private void index(){
  MessageBox.Show("hello world");
}
``` 

```javascript
var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
alert(s);
```
 
```python
s = "Python syntax highlighting"
print s
```
 
```
No language indicated, so no syntax highlighting. 
But let's throw in a <b>tag</b>.
```


```cpp
for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++)
{
    std::cout << i;
}
```
