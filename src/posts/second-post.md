# Stuff
Hello, here is some code:

This is [Web Biscuit](http://www.webbiscuit.co.uk)


This is [an example](http://example.com/ "Title") inline link.

[This link](http://example.net/) has no title attribute.

I get 10 times more traffic from [Google][1] than from [Yahoo][2] or [MSN][3].

[1]: http://google.com/        "Google"
[2]: http://search.yahoo.com/  "Yahoo Search"
[3]: http://search.msn.com/    "MSN Search"


I like [WebBiscuit][4] and [CrumglyHeadGames][5].

[4]: http://www.webbiscuit.co.uk       "Web Biscuit"
[5]: http://www.crumblyheadgames.co.uk "Crumbly Head Games"

I *think* this **works**.  
I am Not sure.

Un**friggin**believable.

You can `print` this.

    void Awesome()
    {
        print ("!HU!");
        return 0;
    }

THat was code.

Please email <daniel@webbiscuit.co.uk>.
